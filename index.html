                <p>Start adding a few spoonfuls to your plate and you're turning an ordinary meal into something more. Ennhancing the taste of a dish doesn't get any easier than with a little salsa sabroza.</br>
                    It can be made to compliment different ends of the taste profile spectrum of the plate or just plain, surprise your palette. Heard of mango habanero? a little sweetness to dance with the heat of an habanero; or the acidity of a lemon, sour and sweet in one package, sure to put any chile in the spotlight.</br>
                    Buying pre-made is well and all and can be handy when in a rush (with minor modifications), but making from scratch is as easy as pie, eating pie that is. I'll show you that with a few base ingredients, you can be on your way to making your own at home lickety-split, before adding any perosnal twists to your liking.</p>

                <h3 class="heads">Lets get the basics down pat.</h3> <!--intro paragraph on salsa comp-->
                <p>We're going to need your pepper of choice, salt, garlic, a source of acidity, and done. That is effectively the foundation to any great salsa.</br>
                    Once you start adding dry herbs and spices, a few tomatoes (green or red), some onion (white, yellow, purple; either chopped or blended in; depends on your internal vision and prep work), and suddenly you've got people asking "Who made this?" and "Can you send me the recipe?". </br>
                    The taste of the final product also varies on how the ingredients are prepared; you can boil, bake/roast or use them raw. I'll be going over two different, but very easy, simple to make recipes. One will be a roasted red sauce (salsa roja) and the other, green (salsa verde) which we will boil. Use these as you please, perhaps as a launching pad to try something new.</p>

                            <p>I know I mentioned this one would be a roasted prep, but since the <em>chile de arbol</em> we are working with is of the dry variation and there isn't many other ingredients in this recipe (until creativity hits you and you start adding some red tomatoes or some onion or some.. you get the idea *wink).</br>
                                We'll only really be using the heat to roast the garlic, <em>with</em> the added benefit of getting the dry pepper to release the natural oils it's conserved since it was initially dried, trust me, the flavor is noticeable. You are more than welcome, even encouraged, to try with the fresh chile if you'd like.</br>
                                <p>You can do this in the oven, but since it's such a small quantity, I opt for the stovestop on a pan of your choice.</br>
                                Heat should be on the high end of medium-high and you only want to do this until the galic starts to get some color on it, occasionally shaking the pan to stir the ingredients within before burning the garlic. This shouldn't take longer than 5-6 mins.</br>
                                Once done, we transfer the garlic and peppers to a pestle and mortar to crush and incorporate (if you do not have one, a food processor or blender will work just as well). At this point, we also add in our salt (coarse for the extra grinding power), and work our ingredients until almost a dry, red paste/powder before squeezing the lime juice in.</br>
                                If you used a blender, simply add the lime juice to the peppers, garlic and salt before blending.</br>
                                Check the consistency, this will be a runnier rather than thick salsa, and give it a taste... that sure packs a bite to it, don't it? This is one where a little goes along way.

                        <h3 class="heads green">Salsa Verde</h3>
                            <p>We'll want to give our peppers and tomatillos a good couple of rinses before starting.</br>
                                Once done, we will place them in a pot and cover with water to boil on medium high for about 6-10 minutes, you'll notice a change in color while boiling and that's fine. We'll let them sit and cool for a few minutes while in the mean time we work on our dry ingedients.</br>
                                (if using a blender, skip to next part) In a pestle and mortar; add the garlic, rosemary, and coarse salt and work them amongst themselves into almost a paste.</br>
                                If the pot has cooled and the ingredients are safe to handle, we'll start of by adding the papers and making sure they're well ground before adding the tomatillos. Be mindful, they're known to pop and splash. That's a bonus point of using a blender and if you do use one, just make sure it's a rough blend, you want to avoid blending the seeds, trust me. Once the consistency is right, taste for salt and done, its ready to serve.</p>
